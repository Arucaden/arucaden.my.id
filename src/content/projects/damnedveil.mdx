> Note: This is a project page for **Damned Veil**, a dark pixel-art game featuring strategic gameplay, magical effects, and immersive visual storytelling.

## Introduction

**Damned Veil** is a dark, horror-themed pixel game set in a mysterious magical world. The gameplay is inspired by the mechanics of carrom â€” players shoot to bounce off surfaces and must carefully plan each shot to defeat enemies.

The core mechanic centers around aiming and shooting a projectile that can bounce off walls and obstacles. Neither the player nor the enemies move, so strategy and precision are everything.

## Unique Features

- ðŸŽ¯ **Carrom-inspired Gameplay** â€” Like carrom, every shot counts. Angles matter, and smart plays can clear the board.
- ðŸ§  **One-hit Kill Easter Egg** â€” Players who discover hidden magical symbols can unlock powerful effects, including the ability to instantly defeat all enemies.
- ðŸ§ª **Boss Battles** â€” Some levels feature Souls-like bosses with layered health bars and evolving patterns, offering a challenging climax.

## My Role: Environment Artist

I was responsible for designing the gameâ€™s atmosphere and environments. What makes this project special for me is my experiment with **normal mapping** in pixel art.

Normal maps allow pixel surfaces to react to light dynamically, creating depth and realism rarely seen in pixel games. Shadows shift naturally, and highlights reflect light direction â€” bringing a fresh sense of magic and immersion to the world.

## Final Thoughts

Damned Veil is a creative experiment blending dark fantasy, puzzle strategy, and pixel art. The result is a game that feels both nostalgic and fresh. With its unique mechanics and eerie aesthetic, itâ€™s more than just another pixel game â€” itâ€™s a mysterious veil waiting to be unveiled.
