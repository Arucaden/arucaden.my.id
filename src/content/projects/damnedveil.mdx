> Note: This is a project page for **Damned Veil**, a dark pixel art game featuring strategic and challenging gameplay with magical and mysterious feels. Created by a team of 4, known as **Round Table**.

### Introduction

**Damned Veil** is a dark, horror-themed pixel game set in a mysterious magical world. The gameplay is inspired by the mechanics of carrom. Player must carefully plan each shot to defeat enemies with limited ammo.

The core mechanic centers around aiming and shooting a projectile that can bounce off walls and obstacles. Neither the player nor the enemies move, so strategy and precision are everything.

### Unique Features

- **Carrom-inspired Gameplay** <br />
Like carrom, every shot counts. Angles matter, and smart plays can clear the map.

- **Easter Egg** <br />
Player who discover mysterious symbols can unlock powerful effect, dare to try it out?.

- **Boss Battles** <br />
Featuring a challenging Souls-like boss that requires careful planning and strategic thinking!.

### My Role: Environment Artist & Programmer

I was responsible for designing the game's atmosphere and environments. What makes this project special for me is my experiment with **normal mapping** in pixel art.
Normal maps allow pixel surfaces to react to light dynamically, creating a fresh sense of magic and immersion to the world that rarely seen in pixel games.

### Challenges

Working on Damned Veil came with a bunch of exciting and ~sometimes painful~ challenges in different areas :

- **Game Design**<br />
  - Making the topdown strategy shooter gameplay feel engaging and not repetitive and boring.
  - Designing levels that are difficult but still fair to win.
  - Creating unusual, unique and challanging boss.

- **Programming**
  - Building a modular enemy spawning system with flexible timing and location settings.
  - Calculating accurate bullet reflection paths to support the core gameplay mechanic.

- **Art & Visuals**
  - Creating a consistent dark fantasy pixel art style that feels immersive.
  - Choosing color palettes that support both atmosphere and readability.
  - Integrating normal maps into 2D pixel based graphic.


### What I Learned

I learned a lot from this project, especially implementing normal mapping in pixel art. It was a challenging because this game is a 2D pixel game, and normal mapping is usually associated with 3D graphics. I had to find ways to make it work in a 2D space while keeping the pixel art with limited tutorial resources. Also this game was built in limited time, so I had to learn how to work efficiently and effectively.


### Final Thoughts

Damned Veil is a creative experiment blending dark fantasy, puzzle strategy, and pixel art. The result is a game that feels both nostalgic and fresh. With its unique mechanics and eerie aesthetic, it's more than just another pixel game **it's a mysterious veil waiting to be unveiled**.
