## My Thought About the Project

- This is my first web projects so it teaches me a lot, like planning, documentation, using Git, and working with a team and more.  
- It was very hard because our lecturer never attended class for the entire semester, and we had to figure out everything by ourselves. However, it was worth learning about web development.
- I still believe Siventi could save some time and hassle if its implemented.
