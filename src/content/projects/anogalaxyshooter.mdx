> Note: This is a project page for **Another Galaxy Shooter**, a simple 2D web space shooter game with basic mechanics and immersive gameplay, built by me.

### Introduction

**Ano Galaxy Shooter** is a fast-paced 2D space shooter where you control a ship trying to survive waves of enemy spaceships. It's simple, but enjoyable.

Fly, shoot, dodge, obtain power. <br />
No deep lore, just good ol' arcade fun in space.

### Unique Features

- **Fast Paced Game** <br />
No worries about spending too much of your precious time on this game.

- **A boss** <br />
Think a small game can't have a boss? Think again! This one does!

### My Role: Programmer
I was built this from scratch no not for the art, but for the programming experience. Why, though? Because I wanted to learn how to build a simple game from the scratch. I wanted to figure out the best and most efficient way to make a game, and I also wanted to experiment with how gameplay feels.
Let me give you an example:
<div style={{ display: "flex", gap: "1rem", flexWrap: "wrap" }}>
  <video
    src="/projectsProperties/anoGalaxyShooter/a.mp4"
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    playsInline
    style={{ flex: "1", minWidth: "300px", borderRadius: "12px" }}
  />

  <video
    src="/projectsProperties/anoGalaxyShooter/b.mp4"
    autoplay
    loop
    muted
    playsInline
    style={{ flex: "1", minWidth: "300px", borderRadius: "12px" }}
  />
</div>

You might feel like: ~WOW SO COOL, I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THIS GAME!~ <br />
I'm joking, no one will be that amazed like that, but the point is, in the second video, I added several feedback elements, like:

- Screen shake when the player gets hit

- The boss blinks when damaged

- Speed-like effect when the player gets a speed power-up,

- Bloom and chromatic aberration (if you noticed).

This is why small effects matter, they make the game feel more immersive and fun to play right?

### Challenges

Challenges?, more like I created them myself just because I wanted to understand how things work behind em:

- **Learning how stuff works:**
  - Quaternion math : I had to wrap my head around how to rotate objects, the camera, and more.
  - Time management in Unity : I learned how to control and smooth out gameplay timing.
  - Vector math : For calculating player and enemy movements precisely.
  - Coroutines : To manage game flow and create smooth sequences of actions.
  - Finite State Machine (FSM) : I used it to control the boss's behavior and skill transitions.
  - I also had to learn how post-processing works to give that juicy visual feedback.

and other many things.

### What I Learned

From this game, I realized how much the **feel** of a game relies on small, intentional details.
I learned not just how to make a game work, but how to make it feel good to play, from responsive controls, visual feedback, to clean and modular code structure.

It taught me the importance of experimentation, iteration, andâ€¦ <br />
Sometimes, **breaking things just to understand how to fix them again.**

### Final Thoughts

Ano Galaxy Shooter is a simple game, but it was a valuable learning experience for me. I got to explore different aspects of game development. Honestly, I had a lot of fun making it.

I did intend to make this game bigger and better... <br />
But yeah, I'm not sure when I'll have the time for that.
So for now, this is it.

*ps : thanks for GameDevHQ for the awesome resources, they helped me a lot in this project.*
